# Docker OpenCV image
Pull requests welcome!

Dockerfile for OpenCV includes contrib modules, specifically OCR.
## Summary
Out of the box this will build OpenCV 3.1.0 and include opencv_contrib modules. It will install Tesseract and Leptonica so that the OpenCV 3.x text recognition and detection modules are available.

## OCR Python Bindings
The Python bindings for the text detection and recognition functions are only present from 3.1.0 onward.
